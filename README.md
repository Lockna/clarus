# clarus
Music player written in Rust used for learning purpose

## About
Since my attention has been drawn to audio in general lately, I've always wondered how audio codecs actually work
With this project I want to take a closer look at that and will wrap this up in a music player.

This is mainly written for the learning effect and therefore I won't program an elaborate GUI, feel free to do so yourself if you want.

Additionally I will switch in the later course (also because of the learning effect) from cpal to an own written audiolib, because also one of the goals is to achieve bit-perfect audio playback which some audiophiles ask for ;)
